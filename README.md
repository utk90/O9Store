# O9Store application

Hi! My name is **Utkarsh Nayan**, I have created this application to cater online shopping services to the users and to get an experience of creating an end to end application. In this, I have used MERN tech stack and Redux for state management.

Scenarios

User has the option to,
> login/logout, register, view/update account details in the application.
> view & buy the products.
> pay using stripe (testing)
> an admin can update product details, order details, user details and has access for dashboard
